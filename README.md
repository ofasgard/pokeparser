# pokeparser

A simple savefile parsing library for Gen III Pokemon games. The parser is well-commented and should be fairly self-explanatory. See the `examples/` folder for some examples of the library in use.

If you want a ready-made tool for save file manipulation, I recommend PkHex. I made this library to help me explore save files from romhacks that don't necessarily result in legal savegame data for FireRed/Emerald/whatever.

I used [this Bulbapedia page](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Save_data_structure_(Generation_III)) extensively to understand the format. I couldn't find the name of the reverse engineer(s) who did all the work to figure out the format, but thanks, whoever you are!
